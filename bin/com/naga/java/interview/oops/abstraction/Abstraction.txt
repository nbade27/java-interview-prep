Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world.
Abstraction is used to describe things in simple terms.It's used to describe things in simple terms.It's used to create boundry between the application and the client program.


There are two types of abstraction
 1.Data Abstraction
 2.Process Abstraction

DataAbstraction :
	When the object data is not visible to the outer world, it creates data abstraction. If needed, access to the Objects’ data is provided through some methods.
Process Abstraction :
	We don’t need to provide details about all the functions of an object. When we hide the internal implementation of the different functions involved in a user operation, it creates process abstraction.

We can implement abstraction through abstractClass and interface in java.

Abstract : is an access modifier and can be applied to classes and methods.

Behaviour of Abstract class : 
		An abstract class is a class that is declared as abstract - it may or may not include abstract methods.
		It is strongly recommended that abstract class should have at least one abstract method. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be used for inheritance only.

Abstract Method : 
	A method is declared without an implementation.
	whenever a class extends an abstract class it should compulsorily override all the abstract methods of the super class. If child class is abstract class then it need to oevrride abstract methods.
When to use :
	These classes will act as Skeleton for similar classes.
	Also we can implement common functionalities of implemented classes as concrete methods in abstract class.


FINAL keyword:
	the final keyword is specified in methods,variables,classes.
	
	For the variables : whenever a variable is declared as final it will become a constant.
	For Methods : Methods cannot be overridden of we declare as final.
	For the classes : A final class can't be extended means it cannot have child and we can create objects;
	
Interfaces
	In java interfaces are reference types.
	We cannot instantiate interfaces.
	These can only implemented by other classes and extended by other interfaces.
	Multiple inheritance is allowed in interfaces.
	One interface can extend one or more interfaces.

If a class that doesn't implement all methods in interface we should declare that class as abstract class.


Multiple Implements :
	A class can implement multiple Interfaces it should override all method in interface. where as it cannot extend multiple classes.
	class - interface --> implements
	interface - class --> implements
	interface - interface --> extends
	class - class --> extends
	
Extending interface :
	when an interface is implementing another interface then the last implemented class  should implement all methods in all above hierarchy interface methods.
